# Smart Message Stream on Ethereum

Saving messages on Ethereum network with some kind of logic.

This project is part of the Hackdays Sailtrhu.

## Objectives

1. Build our first DApp (Decentralized App) on the blockchain
2. Learn Solidity programming language
3. "Replicate" our Message Stream on the blockchain
4. Make our Messages stateful and ‘smart’
  - Can’t ‘like’ a message you published

## Building and the frontend

1. First run `truffle compile`, then run `truffle migrate` to deploy the contracts onto your network of choice (default "development").
1. Then run `npm run dev` to build the app and serve it on http://localhost:8080
